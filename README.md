This is just a quick refresher on basic HTML and git use. I'm doing this since the updated the content of the beginging courses right before I left for the Azore - so I figured swinging back into matters this would be a good way to realign.

this project is just a basic recipe linking webpage to illustrate that I know how to use links and images and whatnot.
